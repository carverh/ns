	<abbr title="Dorper Object Oriented Programming System">DOOPS</abbr> is an operating system designed around a central tree called the <i>Thing Tree</i>.
	It was started in 2018 and was written in C++ and x86 Assembly. It was my first attempt at making a 64-bit operating system.
	I later used the Thing Tree as the base for XtOS's object manager.
