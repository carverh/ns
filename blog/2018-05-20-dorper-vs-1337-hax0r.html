	<p>A so called "hacker" named Pr0xy joined the Unix-Like discord server and started posting his "hacker tutorials" which were deleted for advertising. For the fun of it I asked him to try to hack Dorper. He said he could hack it but then left the server less than a hour later with Dorper still being left unhacked. This is the chatlog from that event.</p>
