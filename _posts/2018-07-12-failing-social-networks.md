<p>Alternative social networks like <a href="https://gab.ai" data-linktype="external" data-val="https://gab.ai">Gab</a>, <a href="https://minds.com" data-linktype="external" data-val="https://minds.com">Minds</a> and <a href="https://bitchute.com" data-linktype="external" data-val="https://bitchute.com">BitChute</a> are failing to grab a wide audience. If you look at the communities of these social networks they are highly politicized and most of the time are right wing. You will not find a lot of cat pictures on these sites or people sharing things that they did on their vacation. Minds is an exception because you can find art and science related posts but a lot of it is political. This is because the target demographic of these social networks are mostly politically active edgelords. These people are angered by the censorship by companies like Facebook, Twitter and Google so they move to alternative networks. Problem is, this creates a mostly right wing echo chamber.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Another issue with alternative social networks is that they want to do something different but often this causes issues. For example, Minds switched over to an Ethereum Blockchain based points system. There was no issue with the points system before, but now it costs 1000 points just to start boosting content. Before you could get points from using the site or doing actions on the site, but now the points you get from doing those actions are so low it resembles a game by Zynga more than a merit based social network like it was before. What's the benefit of putting points on the Blockchain? (Ottman if you can tell me the reason why Minds points need to be on the blockchain please respond in a comment.)</p>

**Author's Note (2/21/2020): I need to write another article about this.**
