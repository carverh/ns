<h1>Crypto is Down Again</h1>
<p>
All cryptocurrencies are down again today. When I say all I mean all. Bitcoin (BTC) is down from $10K to just over $7K and Ethereum is down from $1,000 to $700. However, I do not believe price matters with cryptos, it's how much it is being used that matters. This week I bought <a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com" title="Software I bought (PICO-8)">PICO-8</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/books/mobile-app-development-books" title="HumbleBundle">books from HumbleBundle</a> and <a href="http://www.celestegame.com" title="Celeste">Celeste</a> using Bitcoin, proving the myth that "you can't buy anything with Bitcoin" is false. With the <a href="https://lightning.network/" title="Lightning Network">Lightning Network</a> coming to Bitcoin which will <i>hopefully</i> fix some of the issues with Bitcoin like the <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-transactionfees.html" title="Bitcoin Avg. Transaction Fee historical chart">fees</a> and <a href="https://blockchain.info/unconfirmed-transactions" title="Live Bitcoin backlog">backlog</a>, things can only get better.
