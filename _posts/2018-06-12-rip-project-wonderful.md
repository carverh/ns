The ad network used on Dorper, Project Wonderful, is shutting down. Due to this, Dorper is going to temporarily remove ads until we can find a replacement. Project Wonderful has been a great ad network to use due to how the ads did not slow down the website and how the ads were interesting. I discovered many web comics and websites myself when looking at the ads on Dorper. Please put any suggestions for an alternative ad network in the comment section. Goodnight Sweet Prince.

**Update (2/21/2020): Dorper now uses AdSense.**
