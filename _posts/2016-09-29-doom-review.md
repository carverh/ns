title: Doom Review

Doom is a staple in the FPS genre. Running on everything from calculators to cars, Doom is on everything... but how good is doom actually? So, one of the features is it uses a raycaster with a truly 3D environment allowing some of the best 3D graphics of the MS-DOS era. Doom itself could be gotten for free as shareware, but you had to pay over $50 for the full verson. The game is dated but still fun. My final rating is a 4 out of 5.

*Reflection (2/21/2020): wow this review is bad, it has bad grammar and does not talk about Doom itself but instead it talks about the Doom Engine.*
