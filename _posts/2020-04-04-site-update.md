I have updated the Dorper website and Dorper services.

## Website
- Added more [projects]({{"/projects"|relative_url}}) and fixed dead links.

## LiteTube
- Captions work now.
- Videos with zero likes and zero dislikes no longer cause a division by zero exception.

[See the full changelog](https://yt.dorper.me/changelog.txt)

## Dch
- [Dch](https://c.d0.cx) works again.
