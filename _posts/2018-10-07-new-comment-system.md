<p>
I have written a comment system in Flask for Dorper. It is inspired by imageboards like Futabally and Tinyboard. However, it is designed to integrate with content using a "tag" system. This allows multiple threads to be in the comment section of one page. It is open source and the source can be found on <a href="https://launchpad.net/dch" title="dch on Launchpad">Launchpad</a>. If you want to check it out, you can make a comment in the comment section of this page or use it as a standard imageboard by going to <a href="https://c.d0.cx">its website</a>.
