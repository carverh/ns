title: LiteTube Analytics Update
date: 2018-10-04

<p><a href="https://yt.dorper.me">Litetube</a> has risen in popularity over the last two months. We currently get around 794 monthly unique users and 2,000 sessions. This adds up to over 16,000 monthly page views. I am expecting Litetube to increase in popularity at an exponential rate like it currently is. I expect around 100 daily unique users every weekday. Adsense is not making that much money however so an alternative revenue source may be needed.</p>
