<p>These online net-neutrality "protests" are getting out of hand and are becoming quite spammy. The most recent "protest" by FightForOurFuture involves tweeting out a large text walls with as many new lines in between words as possible. This makes each "protest tweet" over 100vh in size. Now, imagine your news feed being flooded with messages telling you to give FightForOurFuture money to "fight against the evil FCC".</p>

<p>If anyone was to post a text wall like this on a chatroom or a forum, they would probably be warned for spam. Please to not post this tweet on twitter as it will make people want to kill Net Neutrality so they can stop seeing these annoying banner ads, tweets, popups and overlays.</p>
